This plugin provides a command which somewhat limits the buffer to a specified range of lines.

...
:[range]NarrowRegion
		This command does the following, with [range] defaulting to
		the current line :
		- store current folds, foldstates and foldoptions
		- delete all folds
		- setl foldopen=undo
		- setl foldclose=all
		- setl foldminlines=0
		- setl foldmethod=manual
		- fold all lines outside of range
		- setup the nice extras, see below
